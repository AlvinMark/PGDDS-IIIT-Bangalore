# PGDDS-IIIT-Bangalore
This repository includes a few projects I worked on during my PG Diploma in Data Science. I've included the R-script with detailed comments and pdf files for consolidated presentations wherever applicable. 
The raw data files for these projects have not been uploaded. However, I may share it exclusively with anyone particularly interested in the details of the Project. I've included a brief description of each project below.

Please Note: If you are a current or future student of the PGDDS program offered by IIIT-Bangalore. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for clarifications. 
However, I strongly discourage you form integrating sections of the code for your submissions. Every submission is evaluated by a plagiarism checker. A handful of students from my cohort have been penalized for indulging in such activities.
